# Reagent Volume Checker

A Streamlit web application that automates reagent level monitoring for specific analyzers, aimed at reducing manual work and potential errors in the loading process.

---

## Features

- Upload PDF exports from supported analyzers (Roche e801 or Beckman AU5800)
- Upload an Excel file listing reagent minimum volumes per analyzer module
- Automatically extract reagent information using OCR
- Compare current reagent availability against minimum requirements
- Identify reagents that:
  - Are below the minimum volume
  - Are expiring within 7 days

---

## Supported Analyzers

- **Roche e801**
- **Beckman AU5800**  

---

## Input Requirements

### Excel Format (per sheet/module)
Each sheet represents a module (e.g., E3, E4), and should contain:

| Reagent Name | Minimum Volume |
|--------------|----------------|
| TSH          | 270            |
| SHBG         | 120            |

Column headers can vary slightly but must include keywords like "reagent" and "min vol".

### PDF Format
- Must be generated by the analyzer (e.g., via print to PDF or scan)
- For Beckman AU5800, landscape orientation is expected
- Multiple pages supported; users can choose which pages to process
